# DualNet: Multi-Task Deep Learning Architecture for Pain and Stress Detection using fNIRS Signals

A PyTorch-based deep learning framework designed to simultaneously classify **pain** and **stress** from functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals. DualNet integrates multiple deep learning paradigms such as **multi-scale convolutions**, **transformers**, **bi-LSTMs**, and **task-specific attention mechanisms**, supporting a **three-phase training strategy** for robust representation learning.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

DualNet is a **multi-task deep learning model** that learns shared and task-specific representations from fNIRS signals. The overall architecture is composed of the following modules:

### 1. 🧱 Shared Feature Extractor (Multi-Scale ConvNet)

- Extracts low-level features using **three parallel 1D convolutional pathways** with kernel sizes 3, 5, and 7.
- Captures multi-scale temporal patterns from the signal.
- Outputs are concatenated along the channel axis for richer representations.

### 2. 🎯 Task-Specific Attention Modules

- Each task (pain/stress) has a dedicated attention block composed of:
  - **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)**: Highlights important channels.
  - **Spatial Attention**: Focuses on informative time regions.
- These modules filter shared features based on task relevance.

### 3. 🔁 Transformer Encoder

- Models temporal dependencies using a multi-layer transformer.
- Includes positional encoding and self-attention over the time axis.

### 4. 🔄 Task-Specific Classification Branches

- Each branch consists of:
  - A feature projection layer.
  - A **Bi-directional LSTM** for sequence learning.
  - Fully connected layers with dropout for robust classification.

### 🚀 Summary

| Task       | Accuracy (%) | Inference Speed (ms) | Params (K) |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|------------|
| Pain       | 87.9         | 12.3                 | 480        |
| Stress     | 90.2         | 12.3                 | 480        |

## 🧪 Training Strategy

The model is trained in **three progressive phases**:

| Phase | Description                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣    | **Self-Supervised Contrastive Pretraining**: Learns generic representations using augmentation-based contrastive loss. |
| 2️⃣    | **Multi-Task Supervised Learning**: Jointly optimizes both pain and stress branches using BCE loss.                    |
| 3️⃣    | **Fine-Tuning**: Further refines the model using a reduced learning rate.                                              |
